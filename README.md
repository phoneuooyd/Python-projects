# Python-projects
This is a repository for my student projects in python,
I will include hobby stuff too.

#1. GoL w/ multiprocessing - my take on multiprocessing. I tried to compare the speed increase from using it for 2d array calculations. 
#2. OOP_python_calendar - simple program to create ical files, i need to improve some thing in it, but it is functional as it is
